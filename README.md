the files under this project are used to get PCM audio sample from the machine microphone using windows wasapi api, the audio sample takes the bit-rate sample of your PC's audio engine, then using the theory of DPCM and linear predictive coding to downs
ample the data bitrate from 32bits or whatever sample your audio engine captures to a sample lower than the original value, the encoder file will follow soon.
